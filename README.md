# BloodSupplyChain
We have designed a (Ethereum) Blockchain powered Blood-Supply-Chain-Solution that aims to resolves two main issue faced during blood donation/collection (future scope included) - 
```
1. Detecting the point/entity which causes the wastage of blood. 
   Using the transaction logs and the ownership change statuses of the blood bags among the entities, 
   the system can keep a track of points which causes malfunction or a time-delay resulting in wastage of blood.

2. Securing Payments among the entities on the trusted network using Smart Contracts. 
   The entities need not worry about the payments made/to-be-made as it will be governed by 
   the smart contracts deployed on to the network. (Ethereum)
